# Heart Disease Mortality & Social Determinants of Health

## Project Overview
This project examines the relationship between **heart disease mortality** and key **social determinants of health (SDOH)**—including income, education, race/ethnicity, and rurality—using **publicly available county-level data from Texas**.

The analysis focuses on identifying socioeconomic patterns associated with higher mortality rates and demonstrating healthcare data analytics and statistical modeling skills relevant to public health and population health research.

## Research Question
How do income, education, race/ethnicity, and rurality relate to heart disease mortality across Texas counties?

---

## Data
- **Source:** Publicly available datasets  
- **Level:** Aggregated county-level data  
- **Geographic scope:** Texas counties  
- **Year:** 2022  
- **Variables:** Heart disease mortality rates and socioeconomic indicators  
- **Privacy:**  
  - No individual-level or patient-level data  
  - No personally identifiable health information (PHI)

All datasets used in this project are publicly available and suitable for open research and analysis.

## Methods & Analysis
This project follows a standard public health analytics workflow:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Correlation analysis  
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression modeling  
- Data visualization for insight communication  

---

## Key Findings
- **Income:** Higher-income counties show significantly lower heart disease mortality rates.
- **Education:** Higher educational attainment is associated with improved health outcomes, particularly in urban counties.
- **Race/Ethnicity:** Hispanic population share is associated with lower mortality; other racial associations are weaker after controlling for socioeconomic factors.
- **Rurality:** Rural counties experience substantially higher heart disease mortality, even after accounting for income and education.

Overall, **income, education, and rurality** are the strongest predictors of heart disease mortality across Texas counties.

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to a single year (2022)  
- No longitudinal trends assessed  
- Behavioral and clinical risk factors not included  
- Findings represent associations, not causal relationships  

---

## Future Work
- Incorporate multi-year data to analyze trends over time  
- Add healthcare access and behavioral risk indicators  
- Extend analysis beyond Texas to additional regions
